# When To Pray
A Twitter Bot that replies with prayer times when you send it a location

Using the wonderful Praytimes code (http://praytimes.org/manual/), the Google Geocoding API, and Tweepy - this app, when loaded, looks for @replies to the bot, parses the location, and sends back prayer times for the location.
